The notebook is a followup to the first 3 notebooks where last implementation was a CNN Encoder-Decoder model with Attention.\n\nDataset used - [English - French Translations](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/en-fr-translation-dataset)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Model architecture\n\nThe Transformer is an Encoder-Decoder Model ->\n\nBasic Model flow = Input -> **Encoder** -> **Decoder** -> Output\n\n    Encoder =\n        Stack of 6 Encoders =\n            Each Encoder =\n                EncoderLayer(\n                    Self-Attention -> Feed-Forward \n                    (each word embedding has its own parallel processing independently. only self attention has dependency on other words)\n               )\n\nThe first encoder layer also contains the embedding layer for word along with positional embedding which it receives as input.

For eg- input layer has the word embeddings)\n\nRepresent input matrix by **inp_mat**\n\nEach encoder layer receives this dim vector as input.\n\n#### Self-Attention\n* For calculating self-attention, 3 weight matrices are maintained for Query(Wq), Key(Wk) and Value(Wv). Each of size **512 X 64** in the paper \n* **inp_mat** is multiplied with each weight matrix to create respective Query(Qv), Key(Kv) and Value(Vv) vectors. Each vector of size - **sent_len X 64**\n* Calculate self-attention score for each word against all other words.\n* Self attention score calculation - \n\n    For each word ->\n        Multiply Qv (query) of the word with other words KvT (key vector transpose)\n        -> returns the score vector(Sv) of size -> **sent_len X sent_len**\n        -> by intution ( the size sent_len X sent_len means a value for each word in the sentence w.r.t all the other words)\n        -> eg - sentence -> Good morning \n        -> Sv could be =           Good  morning\n                         Good       [1.5,  2.7\n                         morning    3.5,   0.3]\n\n\n* Divide Sv by 8 (square root of key vector size - 64). For more stable gradients as per paper.\n* Pass Sv through softmax operation to normalize the scores and make them add up to 1.\n* Matrix **Sv(size - sent_len X sent_len)** is multiplied with Matrix **Vv(size - sent_len X 64)**. This produces the output of the self attention layer. Output size - **sent_len X 64\n* By intitution, in the last step -> multiplying each words value vector by the current word's attention score for that vector highlights important words as their attention score would be more and diminshing other words with lower attention score as they get multiplied  with values like 0.0001.\n* Let's call this output matrix Z (size - **sent_len X 64**)\n\n##### Multi-headed attention\n* Following from the previous step -> instead of a single set of weight matrices (Wq, Wk, Wv), consider multiple sets of these matrices (in paper 8 sets of query, key and value matrices are used).\n* Now each of these sets are used separately to process the self-attention flow listed above and produce their respective Z matrix as output -> (in paper Z1, Z2....Z8 -> 8 matrices).\n* This is called multi-headed attention. This is helpful for the model to look at differnt patterns in the sentences and maybe consider different sub-sentences lengths in different heads.\n\n##### Final Processing of Self-Attention\n* Concatenate all Z matrices -> along the column -> matrix of size - sent_len X (64X8) = **sent_len X 512**\n* Multiply with another weight matrix W0 (this matrix is also learned along with the model) -> output O => size - **sent_len X 512**\n\n#### Feed-Forward\n* Now the output **O from Self-Attention** is passed to feed forward network. Each word embedding goes through a separate feed forward network. **So, the no. of feed forward networks = sent_len**.\n* **Feed forward input 1 X 512**  -> **Feed forward output 1 X 512**\n* All word outputs together form an output Fi matrix of size -> **sent_len X 512** -> which is the output of Encoder layer i. This will serve as the input of the next encoder layer and is of the same dimension as input to the encoder layer.\n* The size is kept constant across layers in transformer.\n\n#### Residuals (LayerNorm - Add & Normalize)\n* Output of each Sublayer(Self-Attention & Feed-Forward) of Encoder layer is summed element wise with the input to that layer and normalized.\n* For eg - Oi output from Self-Attention is added with Embedding in the first encoder layer and output Ei-1 in the other encoder layers and normalized. Fi output from feed-forward layer is added with Oi output from Self-Attention just before it that has been normalized and the sum is further normalized.\n\n(ignoring embedding here in the first case for generic representation)\nEncoder single layer process ->\n\n    Input inp (sent_len X 512) ->\n        Self-Attention ->\n            W = 8 sets of Wq, Wk, Wv\n            Z = []\n            for (Wk, Wq, Wv) in W:\n                Qv = inp X Wq (sent_len X 64)\n                Kv = inp X Wk (sent_len X 64)\n                Vv = inp X Wv (sent_len X 64)\n\n                Sv = Qv X KvT (sent_len X sent_len)\n                Sv = Sv/8  (for stable gradients)\n                Sv = Softmax(Sv) (for normalizing and making sure all values sum upto 1)\n                Zi = Sv X Vv (sent_len X 64)\n                Z.append(Z)\n                \n             Zconcat = Z1.concat(Z2).concat(Z3)....concat(Z8)   (sent_len X 512)\n             \n             FI = Zconcat X Wo (sent_len X 512)\n             \n             FI = FI + inp (residual adding)\n             FI = norm(FI)\n        \n        Feed-Forward ->\n             FO = []\n             for i in parallel_process(sent_len):\n                 FOi = FI[i] -> feed-forward layer (1 X 512)\n                 FO.concat(FOi)\n                 \n             FO (sent_len X 512)\n             FO = FO + FI (residual summing)\n             FO = norm(FO) (layer norm)\n             \n        Encoder layer output = FO\n             \n            \n            \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
